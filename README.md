# Prom night vote
This is a website that I built for a prom night for my high school.
# How it works
When they enter the students get a ticket with a code that allows them to vote on the website.
When they enter the code on the website, the code is deleted from the database so they can't vote twice with the same code.
Also, after they vote a cookie is created that does not allow them to vote again if they go a page back.

*The generate.php file generates random voting codes*
<br>
*The poll.sql file it's the import for the database that also has 500 voting codes.*
